# SPRIG-REACT
 
a reimplimentation of [Sprig UI](https://github.com/alanbsmith/sprig-ui) in React

### UP & RUNNING

So, at this point it's just the design, no real functionality, but it will mimic Spring UI when it's done.

All you really need to do at this point is run:
 
```
open public/index.html -a firefox
```
